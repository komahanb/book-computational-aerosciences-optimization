# COMPUTATIONAL AEROSCIENCES & OPTIMIZATION

The book is written for individuals interested in a broad class of problems governed by the **mathematical principle of optimization**, as it manifests across structures and patterns in **probability, space** and **time**.  

In other words, it is my journey across **probabilistic--space--time (PST)**. 

>  For since the fabric of the universe is most perfect and the work of a most wise Creator, nothing at all takes place in the universe in which some rule of maximum or minimum does not appear.
>
> Leonard Euler [1707-1783]
