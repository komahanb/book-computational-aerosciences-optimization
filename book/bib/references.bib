abstract = "Since the early 1990s, there has been a strongly increasing demand for more efficient methods to solve large sparse, unstructured linear systems of equations. For practically relevant problem sizes, classical one-level methods had already reached their limits and new hierarchical algorithms had to be developed in order to allow an efficient solution of even larger problems. This paper gives a review of the first hierarchical and purely matrix-based approach, algebraic multigrid (AMG). AMG can directly be applied, for instance, to efficiently solve various types of elliptic partial differential equations discretized on unstructured meshes, both in 2D and 3D. Since AMG does not make use of any geometric information, it is a “plug-in” solver which can even be applied to problems without any geometric background, provided that the underlying matrix has certain properties."

Contrary to commonly implemented intrusive methods built on a problem specific-approach that depends on the governing PDEs, the proposed method, although intrusive in nature, can easily be implemented to any system of equations. A proper mathematical framework is developed that performs the derivation and numerical solution of the iPCE equations with little additional effort, avoiding the laborious mathematical and software development commonly associated with intrusive approaches. Computational cost, convergence and stability properties are analyzed in detail and discussed. The proposed uncertainty quantification (UQ) method is applied to the Reynolds-Averaged Navier–Stokes (RANS) equations, coupled with the Spalart–Allmaras turbulence model and results are compared with those of the non-intrusive PCE (niPCE)."

                  optimization (TO) is a growing trend with designers
                  recognizing that deterministic analysis does not
                  reflect the natural variabilities found in real
                  world structural analysis. Thus far the majority of
                  works have dealt with uncertain loading and material
                  properties however minimal research has considered
                  uncertain boundary conditions (BCs), which plays a
                  vital role for both static and dynamic analysis
                  involving natural compliance/frequency objectives
                  and/or constraints. This paper will implement BCs
                  uncertainty on a cantilevered flat plate by assuming
                  that a gaussian-distributed number of nodes can be
                  freed from the structure. Two single objective
                  formulations are conducted involving minimizing
                  compliance and maximizing fundamental frequency
                  while enforcing a volume fraction constraint. A
                  robust formulation is developed using Non-intrusive
                  Polynomial Chaos (NIPC) to minimize the variance of
                  the objectives. Results show that the stochastic
                  algorithm produces topologies which indeed
                  out-perform the deterministic in terms of
                  mean/variance and worst case objective
                  values. Further, the outcomes suggest that there is
                  diminishing returns beyond a certain weighting for
                  standard deviation in the objective function. }

abstract = {Summary The topology optimization problem of a continuum structure on the compliance minimization objective is investigated under consideration of the external load uncertainty in its application position with a nonprobabilistic approach. The load position is defined as the uncertain-but-bounded parameter and is represented by an interval variable with a nominal application point. The structural compliance due to the load position deviation is formulated with the quadratic Taylor series expansion. As a result, the objective gradient information to the topological variables can be evaluated efficiently in a quadratic expression. Based on the maximum design sensitivity value, which corresponds to the most sensitive compliance to the uncertain loading position, a single-level optimization approach is suggested by using a popular gradient-based optimality criteria method. The proposed optimization scheme is performed to gain the robust topology optimizations of three benchmark examples, and the final configuration designs are compared comprehensively with the conventional topology optimizations under the loading point fixation. It can be observed that the present method can provide remarkably different material layouts with auxiliary components to accommodate the load position disturbances. The numerical results of the representative examples also show that the structural performances of the robust topology optimizations appear less sensitive to the load position perturbations than the traditional designs.},

Uncertainty is introduced in loading and in geometry to address the manufacturing variability. The manufacturing variability is modeled via a thresholding technique in which the threshold field is represented by a reduced dimensional random field. Response metrics such as compliance and volume are characterized as polynomial chaos expansions of the underlying uncertain parameters thus allowing accurate and efficient estimation of statistical moments, failure probabilities and their sensitivities. The number of simulations is reduced for linear structures under loading uncertainty by means of superposition. Efficiency of the non-intrusive polynomial chaos approach is highlighted by comparison with the Monte Carlo method in terms of the number of simulations. To demonstrate the effect of uncertainty, optimized designs that consider uncertainty are compared to those that do not. Comparisons of polynomial chaos expansion to existing analytical methods on a benchmark numerical example are also provided for reliability-based and worst case designs."

abstract = {Abstract When geometric uncertainties arising from manufacturing errors are comparable with the characteristic length or the product responses are sensitive to such uncertainties, the products of deterministic design cannot perform robustly. This paper presents a new level set-based framework for robust shape and topology optimization against geometric uncertainties. We first propose a stochastic level set perturbation model of uncertain topology/shape to characterize manufacturing errors in conjunction with Karhunen–Loève (K–L) expansion. We then utilize polynomial chaos expansion to implement the stochastic response analysis. In this context, the mathematical formulation of the considered robust shape and topology optimization problem is developed, and the adjoint-variable shape sensitivity scheme is derived. An advantage of this method is that relatively large shape variations and even topological changes can be accounted for with desired accuracy and efficiency. Numerical examples are given to demonstrate the validity of the present formulation and numerical techniques. In particular, this method is justified by the observations in minimum compliance problems, where slender bars vanish when the manufacturing errors become comparable with the characteristic length of the structures.

This paper considers simultaneous minimization of expectancy and variance of compliance in the presence of uncertainties in loading magnitude, using exact formulations and analytically derived sensitivities. It shows that only a few additional load cases are required, which scales in polynomial time with the number of uncertain load cases. The approach is implemented using the level set topology optimization method. Shape sensitivities are derived using the adjoint method. Several examples are used to investigate the effect of including variance in robust compliance optimization. }

abstract = "A computational method for topology optimization in the presence of uncertainty is proposed. The method combines the spectral stochastic approach for the representation and propagation of uncertainties with an existing deterministic topology optimization technique. The idea in spectral stochastic formulations is to add an extra dimension, a random dimension, to the problem where the stochastic variability of the input parameters (and outputs of interest) can be modeled. The resulting compact representations for the response quantities allow for efficient and accurate calculation of sensitivities of response statistics with respect to the design variables which are then fed into a gradient-based optimizer that searches for the optimum design. From a variety of frameworks for uncertainty-informed optimization, robust topology optimization is chosen to demonstrate the applicability of the method. Examples from continuum topology optimization under uncertainty in material properties are presented. It is also shown that results obtained from the proposed method are in excellent agreement with those obtained from a Monte Carlo-based optimization algorithm."

abstract = "This paper presents algorithms for solving structural
                  topology optimization problems with uncertainty in
                  the magnitude and location of the applied loads and
                  with small uncertainty in the location of the
                  structural nodes. The second type of uncertainty
                  would typically arise from fabrication errors where
                  the tolerances for the node locations are small in
                  relation to the length scale of the structural
                  elements. We first review the discrete form of the
                  uncertain loads problem, which has been previously
                  solved using a weighted average of multiple load
                  patterns. With minor modifications, we extend this
                  solution to include loads described by continuous
                  joint probability density functions. We then proceed
                  to the main contribution of this paper: structural
                  optimization under uncertainty in the nodal
                  locations. This optimization problem is
                  computationally difficult because it involves
                  variations of the inverse of the structural
                  stiffness matrix. It is shown, however, that for
                  small uncertainties the problem can be recast into a
                  simpler but equivalent structural optimization
                  problem with equivalent uncertain loads. By
                  expressing these equivalent loads in terms of
                  continuous random variables, we are able to make use
                  of the extended form of the uncertain loads problem
                  presented in the first part of this paper. The
                  optimization algorithms are developed in the context
                  of minimum compliance (maximum stiffness)
                  design. Simple examples are presented. The results
                  demonstrate that load and nodal uncertainties can
                  have dramatic impact on optimal design. For
                  structures containing thin substructures under axial
                  loads, it is shown that these uncertainties (a) are
                  of first-order significance, influencing the linear
                  elastic response quantities, and (b) can affect
                  designs by avoiding unrealistically optimistic and
                  potentially unstable structures. The additional
                  computational cost associated with the uncertainties
                  scales linearly with the number of uncertainties and
                  is insignificant compared to the cost associated
                  with solving the deterministic structural
                  optimization problem."

First, we examine the question of which inertial nonlinearities should be included in the equations of motion for purposes of simulation. A complete model incorporating all inertial terms that couple rigid-body and elastic motions is presented along with a rational scheme for classifying them. Second, the issue of geometric nonlinearities is discussed. These are terms whose origin is the geometrically nonlinear theory of elasticity, as well as the terms arising from the interbody coupling due to the elastic deformation at the link tip. Accordingly, a general way of incorporating the well-known geometric stiffening effect is presented along with several schemes for treating the elastic kinematics at the joint interconnections. In addition, the question of basis function selection for spatial discretization of the elastic displacements is also addressed. The finite element method and an eigenfunction expansion techniques are presented and compared. All issues are examined numerically in the context of a simple beam example and the Space Shuttle Remote Manipulator System. Unlike a single-link system, the results for the latter show that all terms are required for accurate simulation of faster maneuvers. Hence, the conclusions of the paper are contrary to some of the previous findings on the validity of various models for dynamics simulation of flexible-body systems.}",

abstract="In recent years, robust design optimization (RDO) has emerged as a significant area of research. The focus of RDO is to obtain a design that minimizes the effects of uncertainty on product reliability and performance. The effectiveness of the resulting solution in RDO highly depends on how the objective function and the constraints are formulated to account for uncertainties. Inequality constraint and objective function formulations under uncertainty have been studied extensively in the literature. However, the approaches for formulating equality constraints in the RDO literature are in a state of disharmony. Moreover, we observe that these approaches are generally applicable only to certain special cases of equality constraints. There is a need for a systematic approach for handling equality constraints in RDO, which is the motivation for this research. In this paper, we examine critical issues pertinent to formulating equality constraints in RDO. Equality constraints in RDO can be classified as belonging to two classes: (1) those that cannot be satisfied, because of the uncertainty inherently present in the RDO problem, and (2) those that must be satisfied, regardless of the uncertainty present in the problem. In this paper, we propose a linearization- based approach to classify equality constraints into the above two classes, and propose respective formulation methods. The theoretical developments presented in this paper are illustrated with the help of two numerical examples.",

abstract = {A hyperjerk system is a dynamical system governed by an nth order ordinary differential equation with n{\textgreater}3 describing the time evolution of a single scalar variable. Such systems are surprisingly general and are prototypical examples of complex dynamical systems in a high-dimensional phase space. This paper describes a numerical study of a simple subclass of such systems and shows that they provide a means to extend the extensive study of chaotic systems with n=3. We present some simple chaotic hyperjerks of 4th and 5th order. Two cases are examined that are apparently the simplest possible chaotic flows for n=4, together with several hyperchaotic cases for n=4 and 5.},

abstract="This paper presents an adjoint method for sensitivity analysis that is used in an aero-structural aircraft design framework. The aero-structural analysis uses high-fidelity models of both the aerodynamics and the structures. Aero-structural sensitivities are computed using a coupled-adjoint approach that is based on previously developed single discipline sensitivity analysis. Alternative strategies for coupled sensitivity analysis are also discussed. The aircraft geometry and a structure of fixed topology are parameterized using a large number of design variables. The aero-structural sensitivities of aerodynamic and structural functions with respect to these design variables are computed and compared with results given by the complex-step derivative approximation. The coupled-adjoint procedure is shown to yield very accurate sensitivities and to be computationally efficient, making high-fidelity aero-structural design feasible for problems with thousands of design variables.",

@article{BauchauBenchmark2016,
abstract = {As the need to model flexibility arose in multibody dynamics, the floating frame of reference formulation was developed, but this approach can yield inaccurate results when elastic displacements becomes large. While the use of three-dimensional finite element formulations overcomes this problem, the associated computational cost is overwhelming. Consequently, beam models, which are one-dimensional approximations of three-dimensional elasticity, have become the workhorse of many flexible multibody dynamics codes. Numerous beam formulations have been proposed, such as the geometrically exact beam formulation or the absolute nodal coordinate formulation, to name just two. New solution strategies have been investigated as well, including the intrinsic beam formulation or the DAE approach. This paper provides a systematic comparison of these various approaches, which will be assessed by comparing their predictions for four benchmark problems. The first problem is the Princeton beam experiment, a study of the static large displacement and rotation behavior of a simple cantilevered beam under a gravity tip load. The second problem, the four-bar mechanism, focuses on a flexible mechanism involving beams and revolute joints. The third problem investigates the behavior of a beam bent in its plane of greatest flexural rigidity, resulting in lateral buckling when a critical value of the transverse load is reached. The last problem investigates the dynamic stability of a rotating shaft. The predictions of eight independent codes are compared for these four benchmark problems and are found to be in close agreement with each other and with experimental measurements, when available.},

abstract = {Implicit integration approaches based on generalized coordinate-partitioning of the differential-algebraic equations of motion of multibody dynamics are presented. The methods developed are intended for simulation of stiff mechanical systems using the well-known Newmark integration method from structural dynamics and more recent implicit Runge-Kutta methods. Newmark integration formulas for second-order differential equations are first used to define independent generalized coordinates and their first time-derivative as functions of independent accelerations. The latter are determined as the solution of discretized equations obtained using the descriptor form of the equations of motion. Dependent variables in the formulation, including Lagrange multipliers, are determined to satisfy all the kinematic and kinetic equations of multibody dynamics. Next, the process is extended to implicit Runge-Kutta methods with variable step size and error control. The approach is illustrated by solving the constrained equations of motion for mechanical systems that exhibit stiff behavior. Results show that the approach is robust and has the capability to integrate differential-algebraic equations of motion for stiff multibody dynamic systems},

the other the beam equations themselves. The crosssectional analysis, along with the accompanying engineering software (VABS), provides an accurate beam representation of the blade structure, allowing  designer to take advantage of composite materials when designing rotor blades.
VARS is able to take into consideration anisotropic, nonhomogeneous materials and to represent general crosssectional geometries, requiring neither the costly use of 3D finite element discretization nor the loss of accuracy inherent in any simplified representation of the cross
section. Results obtained from analysis of a variety of composite beam are presented. The generality of the method and accuracy of the results should increase confidence at the design stage that the structure will perform as expected and, consequently, should lower costs from experimental
tests and further adjustments.",

abstract = "The aeroelastic stability of flap bending, leadlag bending and torsion of a composite rotor blade in hover is shown to be strongly influenced by structural coupling terms which depend on fibers orientation. This effect is investigated using a finite element theory based on Hamilton's
principle. The blade is treated as a single cell laminated shell beam composed of an arbitrary layup of composite plies. The energy expressions and governing differential equations are derived for moderately large deflections. Stiffness coupling terms caused by bendingtorsion
and extensiontorsion couplings are identified. Quasisteady strip theory is used to obtain aerodynamic forces. The blade is discretized into beam elements, each with fifteen nodal degrees of freedom. The nonlinear equations of motion are solved for steady deflection using an
iterative procedure. The flutter solution is calculated assuming blade motions to be small perturbations about the steady solution, and the normal mode approach based on coupled vibration modes is used. Numerical results are calculated for selected structural configurations, categorized as
symmetric and antisymmetric according to the layup of laminae on opposing flanges. A systematic study is made to identify the importances of the stiffness coupling terms on blade dynamic stability with changing fiber orientation and for different configurations. For same structural
configurations, the analysis shows that nonlinear coupling terms have a substantial influence on blade dynamics.",

abstract="Most formulations for sensitivity derivatives of structural response require detail-level computations (e.g. element-level calculations for finite-element systems). This requirement is a major difficulty in this age of ``black box'' commercial structural-analysis software which typically does not provide the user with access to that level of detail. A recent formulation of sensitivity analysis by Mr{\'o}z and Dems provides a solution to this difficulty. The sensitivity calculations only require the solution of the original problem with new imposed loading consisting of initial stresses and initial strains. Therefore, they require only that the structural analysis program allow these type of loading. The present paper demonstrates the application of this approach to one and two-dimensional problems, using a finite-element program and a nonlinear shell analysis program.",

The GSE method provides an efficient approach for representing a large coupled system by smaller subsystems and accounts for the subsystem interactions by means of first-order behavior sensitivities. This approach was applied in an aircraft synthesis problem with performance constraints stemming from the disciplines of structures, aerodynamics, and flight mechanics. Approximation methods were considered in an attempt to reduce problem dimensionality and to improve the efficiency of the optimization process. The influence of efficient constraint representations, the choice of design variables, and design variable scaling on the conditioning of the system matrix was also investigated.},

abstract = {A method is presented for computing sensitivity derivatives with respect to independent (input) variables for complex, internally coupled systems, while avoiding the cost and inaccuracy of finite differencing performed on the entire system analysis. The method entails two alternative algorithms: the first is based on the classical implicit function theorem formulated on residuals of governing equations, and the second develops the system sensitivity equations in a new form using the partial (local) sensitivity derivatives of the output with respect to the input for each part of the system. A few application examples are presented to illustrate the discussion. The method has potential to answer the "what if" questions by presenting engineers with sensitivity information on design tradeoffs to guide human judgment and formal optimization. In addition, the method is compatible with the modern technology of distributed computing as well as traditional division of design tasks among groups of specialists in the design process. The capability to quantify the effects of proposed design changes may provide the basis for a mathematical model of design.},

abstract = "The choice of a numerical method for the solution of ordinary differential equations depends on the associated boundary conditions. When all the boundary conditions are specified at one end of the range of integration, one of the well-known step-by-step methods will generally be used, while the method of relaxation is reserved for the case in which boundary conditions are specified at more than one point (1). In the latter, simple but inaccurate finite-difference formulae are used to provide a first approximation to the required solution; this approximation is then used to give an estimate of the errors involved in the use of the inaccurate formulae, and successive corrections are obtained until the full, accurate finite-difference equations are satisfied (1). The same principle is followed in this paper with regard to step-by-step methods, the main difference being the way in which approximate solutions are obtained. In relaxation methods simultaneous equations are solved, while in th" # "e use of the step-by-step methods suggested here successive pivotal values are built up by the use of recurrence relations. All the methods of this paper follow this principle, differing only in the method of obtaining a recurrence relation, and consequently in the form of the correction terms.",

Therefore, the adjoint method shows an efficient way to incorporate inverse dynamics to engineering multibody applications, e.g., trajectory tracking or parameter identification in the field of robotics.

abstract="This paper presents a recursive direct differentiation method for sensitivity analysis of flexible multibody systems. Large rotations and translations in the system are modeled as rigid body degrees of freedom while the deformation field within each body is approximated by superposition of modal shape functions. The equations of motion for the flexible members are differentiated at body level and the sensitivity information is generated via a recursive divide and conquer scheme. The number of differentiations required in this method is minimal. The method works concurrently with the forward dynamics simulation of the system and requires minimum data storage. The use of divide and conquer framework makes the method linear and logarithmic in complexity for serial and parallel implementation, respectively, and ideally suited for general topologies. The method is applied to a flexible two arm robotic manipulator to calculate sensitivity information and the results are compared with the finite difference approach.",

Based on Lagrange equations of multibody system dynamics, a general objective function, constraint conditions, initial and end conditions, the adjoint variable equations for first order sensitivity analysis and design sensitivity formulations are derived firstly. Then, second order sensitivity analysis formulations, as well as the detailed computation steps, are given based on the previous results. For simplification, the second derivative of the objective function with respect to design variables is translated into an initial value problem of an ordinary differential equation with one variable.

abstract = "A continuous adjoint approach for obtaining sensitivity derivatives on unstructured grids is developed and analyzed. The derivation of the costate equations is presented, and a second-order accurate discretization method is described. The relationship between the continuous formulation and a discrete formulation is explored for inviscid, as well as for viscous flow. Several limitations in a strict adherence to the continuous approach are uncovered, and an approach that circumvents these difficulties is presented. The issue of grid sensitivities, which do not arise naturally in the continuous formulation, is investigated and is observed to be of importance when dealing with geometric singularities. A method is described for modifying inviscid and viscous meshes during the design cycle to accommodate changes in the surface shape. The accuracy of the sensitivity derivatives is established by comparing with finite-difference gradients and several design examples are presented. "

We then review the past developments in this field, before introducing the features that characterize the newer algorithms. In the context of a trust region framework, we focus on techniques that ensure a suitable ``geometric quality'' of the considered models. We then outline the class of algorithms based on these techniques, as well as their respective merits. We finally conclude the paper with a discussion of open questions and perspectives.",

abstract="The majority of work in the thermal structures field has focused on reducing or eliminating thermal stresses by accommodating thermal expansion. In the modern day, several new applications, including engine exhaust-washed structures for embedded engine aircraft, are posing new design scenarios where this prescription is not possible. Thus it becomes necessary to utilize new design techniques to solve the problem of stiffening and stress reduction in thermal structures with restrained thermal expansion. In this work, a design scenario is presented to demonstrate the challenges associated with the design of thin shell structures in a thermal environment and the breakdown of common design methodologies. These challenges include a fundamental non-intuitiveness in the design space and the design dependency that occurs with thermal loading. Three different topology optimization formulations are investigated to solve this problem. The effectiveness of each of these methods is benchmarked against one another and general recommendations are made regarding effective design solutions for restrained thermal structures.",

abstract="The design of thermal structures in the aerospace industry, including exhaust structures on embedded engine aircraft and hypersonic thermal protection systems, poses a number of complex design challenges. These challenges are particularly well addressed by the material layout capabilities of structural topology optimization; however, no topology optimization methods are readily available with the necessary thermoelastic considerations for these problems. This is due in large part to the emphasis on cases of maximum stiffness design for structures subjected to externally applied mechanical loads in the majority of topology optimization applications. In addition, while limited work in the literature has investigated thermoelastic topology optimization, a direct treatment of thermal stresses is not well documented. Such a treatment is critical in the design of thermal structures where excessive thermal stresses are a primary failure mode. In this paper, we present a method for the topology optimization of structures with combined mechanical and thermoelastic (temperature) loads that are subject to stress constraints. We present the necessary steps needed to address both the design-dependent thermal loads and accommodate the challenges of stress-based design criteria. A relaxation technique is utilized to remove the singularity phenomenon in stresses and the large number of stress constraints is handled using a scaled aggregation technique that has been shown previously to satisfy prescribed stress limits in mechanical problems. Finally, the stress-based thermoelastic formulation is applied to two numerical example problems to demonstrate its effectiveness.",

journal="Structural and Multidisciplinary Optimization",
year="2012",
volume="45",
number="6",
pages="773--786",
abstract="With design independent loads and only a constrained volume (no local bounds), the same optimal design leads simultaneously to minimum compliance and maximum strength. However, for thermoelastic structures this is not the case and a maximum volume may not be an active constraint for minimum compliance. This is proved for thermoelastic structures by sensitivity analysis of compliance that facilitates localized determination of sensitivities, and the compliance is not identical to the total elastic energy (twice strain energy). An explicit formula for the difference is derived and numerically illustrated with examples. In compliance minimization for thermoelastic structures it may be advantageous to decrease the total volume, but for strength maximization it is argued to keep the total permissible volume. Linear interpolation (no penalization) may to a certain extent be argued for 2D thickness optimized designs, but for 3D design problems interpolation must be included and not only from the penalization point of view to obtain 0--1 designs. Three interpolation types are presented in a uniform manner, including the well known one parameter penalizations, named SIMP and RAMP. An alternative two parameter interpolation in explicit form is preferred, and the influence of interpolation on compliance sensitivity analysis is included. For direct strength maximization the sensitivity analysis of local von Mises stresses is demanding. An applied recursive procedure to obtain uniform energy density is presented in details, and it is shown by examples that the obtained designs are close to fulfilling also strength maximization. Explicit formulas for equivalent thermoelastic loads in 2D and 3D finite element analysis are derived and applied, including the sensitivity analysis.",

abstract="For thermoelastic structures the same optimal design does not simultaneously lead to minimum compliance and maximum strength. Compliance may be a questionable objective and focus for the present paper is on the important aspect of strength, quantified as minimization of the maximum von Mises stress. With compliance defined as the product of resulting displacements and their corresponding total loads, then for thermoelastic problems compliance is different from total elastic energy. An explicit formula for this difference is derived and numerically illustrated in the optimized examples. As an alternative to mathematical programming, which with a large number of both design variables and strength constraints, is found non-practical, we choose simple recursive iterations to obtain uniform energy density and find by examples that the obtained designs are close to fulfilling also strength maximization. In compliance minimization it may be advantageous to decrease the total volume, but for strength maximization it is argued that it is advantageous to keep the total permissible volume. With the thermoelastic analysis presented directly in a finite element formulation, simple explicit formulas for equivalent thermoelastic loads are appended.",

pages="837",
abstract="This paper describes the topology optimization of thermoelastic structures, using level set method. The objective is to minimize the mean compliance of a structure with a material volume constraint. In level set method, free boundary of a structure is considered as design variable, and it is implicitly represented via level set model. Objective function of the optimization problem is defined as a function of the shape of a structure. Sensitivity analysis based on continuum model is conducted with respect to the free boundary, which suggests the steepest descent direction. A geometric energy term is introduced to ensure smooth structural boundary. Augmented Lagrangian multiplier method is adopted to enforce volume constraint. Numerical examples are provided for 2D cases, considering design independent temperature distribution.",

abstract="Topology optimization is the process of determining the optimal layout of material and connectivity inside a design domain. This paper surveys topology optimization of continuum structures from the year 2000 to 2012. It focuses on new developments, improvements, and applications of finite element-based topology optimization, which include a maturation of classical methods, a broadening in the scope of the field, and the introduction of new methods for multiphysics problems. Four different types of topology optimization are reviewed: (1) density-based methods, which include the popular Solid Isotropic Material with Penalization (SIMP) technique, (2) hard-kill methods, including Evolutionary Structural Optimization (ESO), (3) boundary variation methods (level set and phase field), and (4) a new biologically inspired method based on cellular division rules. We hope that this survey will provide an update of the recent advances and novel applications of popular methods, provide exposure to lesser known, yet promising, techniques, and serve as a resource for those new to the field. The presentation of each method's focuses on new developments and novel applications.",

title="Simultaneous material and structural optimization by multiscale topology optimization",
journal="Structural and Multidisciplinary Optimization",
year="2016",
pages="1--15",
abstract="This paper introduces a new approach to multiscale optimization, where design optimization is applied at two scales: the macroscale, where the structure is optimized, and the microscale, where the material is optimized. Thus, structure and material are optimized simultaneously. We approach multiscale design optimization by linearizing and formulating a new way to decompose into macro and microscale design problems in such a way that solving the decomposed problems separately lead to an overall optimum solution. In addition, the macro and microstructural designs are coupled tightly through homogenization and inverse homogenization. This approach is generic in that it allows any number of unique microstructures and can be applied to a wide range of design problems. An advantage of decomposing the problem in this physical way is that it is potentially straight forward to specify additional design requirements at a specific scale or in specific regions of the design domain. The decomposition approach also allows an easy parallelization of the computational methodology and this enables the computational time to be maintained at a practical level. We demonstrate the proposed approach using the level-set topology optimization at both scales, i.e. macrostructural topological design and microstructural topology of architected material. A series of optimization problems, minimizing compliance and compliant mechanism are solved for verification and investigation of potential benefits.",

Although some remarkable achievements have been made with this computational framework, there are still some issues requiring further explorations.

abstract="This work extends the Discrete Material and Thickness Optimization approach to structural optimization problems where strength considerations in the form of failure criteria are taken into account for laminated composite structures. It takes offset in the density approaches applied for stress constrained topology optimization of single-material problems and develops formulations for multi-material topology optimization problems applied for laminated composite structures. The method can be applied for both stress- and strain-based failure criteria. The large number of local constraints is reduced by the use of aggregate functions, and the developed approach is demonstrated for optimization problems involving both constant and varying thickness laminated composites.",

abstract="The purpose of this article is to benchmark different optimization solvers when applied to various finite element based structural topology optimization problems. An extensive and representative library of minimum compliance, minimum volume, and mechanism design problem instances for different sizes is developed for this benchmarking. The problems are based on a material interpolation scheme combined with a density filter. Different optimization solvers including Optimality Criteria (OC), the Method of Moving Asymptotes (MMA) and its globally convergent version GCMMA, the interior point solvers in IPOPT and FMINCON, and the sequential quadratic programming method in SNOPT, are benchmarked on the library using performance profiles. Whenever possible the methods are applied to both the nested and the Simultaneous Analysis and Design (SAND) formulations of the problem. The performance profiles conclude that general solvers are as efficient and reliable as classical structural topology optimization solvers. Moreover, the use of the exact Hessians in SAND formulations, generally produce designs with better objective function values. However, with the benchmarked implementations solving SAND formulations consumes more computational time than solving the corresponding nested formulations.",

abstract="This review presents developed models, theory, and numerical methods for structural optimization of trusses with discrete design variables in the period 1968 -- 2014. The comprehensive reference list collects, for the first time, the articles in the field presenting deterministic optimization methods and meta heuristics. The field has experienced a shift in focus from deterministic methods to meta heuristics, i.e. stochastic search methods. Based on the reported numerical results it is however not possible to conclude that this shift has improved the competences to solve application relevant problems. This, and other, observations lead to a set of recommended research tasks and objectives to bring the field forward. The development of a publicly available benchmark library is urgently needed to support development and assessment of existing and new heuristics and methods. Combined with this effort, it is recommended that the field begins to use modern methods such as performance profiles for fair and accurate comparison of optimization methods. Finally, theoretical results are rare in this field. This means that most recent methods and heuristics are not supported by mathematical theory. The field should therefore re-focus on theoretical issues such as problem analysis and convergence properties of new methods.",

abstract="Multi-material topology optimization is a practical tool that allows for improved structural designs. However, most studies are presented in the context of continuum topology optimization -- few studies focus on truss topology optimization. Moreover, most work in this field has been restricted to linear material behavior with limited volume constraint settings for multiple materials. To address these issues, we propose an efficient multi-material topology optimization formulation considering material nonlinearity. The proposed formulation handles an arbitrary number of candidate materials with flexible material properties, features freely specified material layers, and includes a generalized volume constraint setting. To efficiently handle such arbitrary volume constraints, we derive a design update scheme that performs robust updates of the design variables associated with each volume constraint independently. The derivation is based on the separable feature of the dual problem of the convex approximated primal subproblem with respect to the Lagrange multipliers, and thus the update of design variables in each volume constraint only depends on the corresponding Lagrange multiplier. Through examples in 2D and 3D, using combinations of Ogden-based, bilinear, and linear materials, we demonstrate that the proposed multi-material topology optimization framework with the presented update scheme leads to a design tool that not only finds the optimal topology but also selects the proper type and amount of material. The design update scheme is named ZPR (phonetically, zipper), after the initials of the authors' last names (Zhang-Paulino-Ramos Jr.).",

abstract = {Summary We present an original mathematical formulation for optimizing structural topology while simultaneously identifying an optimal set of design materials that are selected from a larger set of candidate materials. This design task is analogous to that, which is commonly encountered in additive manufacturing applications in which the 3D printer can print parts containing up to 3 distinct materials that can be selected from a larger suite of usable materials. The material distribution is parameterized via the shape functions with penalization formulation in which a set of activation functions, which are derived from a partition of the unit hypercube, is used to determine the effective local elasticity modulus within a single finite element. Additionally, we introduce an inverse p‐norm function, which is used to ensure that the optimized material properties converge to a set of discrete values corresponding to the available candidate materials. The algorithm has been implemented on a set of 2D benchmark problems. Numerical results show that the formulation combining the inverse p‐norm function with the activation functions successfully produces optimized multimaterial solutions containing no more than the prescribed number of distinct materials.}

abstract = {Abstract This work is focused on the topology optimization of lightweight structures consisting of multiphase materials. Instead of adopting the common idea of using volume constraint, a new problem formulation with mass constraint is proposed. Meanwhile, recursive multiphase materials interpolation (RMMI) and uniform multiphase materials interpolation (UMMI) schemes are discussed and compared based on numerical tests and theoretical analysis. It is indicated that the nonlinearity of the mass constraint introduced by RMMI brings numerical difficulties to attain the global optimum of the optimization problem. On the contrary, the UMMI‐2 scheme makes it possible to formulate the mass constraint in a linear form with separable design variables. One such formulation favors very much the problem resolution by means of mathematical programming approaches, especially the convex programming methods. Moreover, numerical analysis indicates that fully uniform initial weighting is beneficial to seek the global optimum when UMMI‐2 scheme is used. Besides, the relationship between the volume constraint and mass constraint is theoretically revealed. The filtering technique is adapted to avoid the checkerboard pattern related to the problem with multiphase materials. Numerical examples show that the UMMI‐2 scheme with fully uniform initial weighting is reliable and efficient to deal with the structural topology optimization with multiphase materials and mass constraint. Meanwhile, the mass constraint formulation is evidently more significant than the volume constraint formulation. Copyright © 2011 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}

The practical realization in applied mechanics can be performed by introducing a foam like material, with variable density as discussed by Bendsøe and Kikuchi. This paper uses for the evaluation of material properties a simple energy approach. The application is extended to three-dimensional domains. Multiple loading cases are also considered. Further, the approach is implemented in a preoptimizer for optimal shape finding. "

Similar ideas as for the standard eigenproblem are used, but the projections, that are required to reduce the given problem to a small manageable size, need more attention. We show that by proper choices for the projection operators quadratic convergence can be achieved. The advantage of our approach is that none of the involved operators needs to be inverted. It turns out that similar projections can be used for the iterative approximation of selected eigenvalues and eigenvectors of polynomial eigenvalue equations. This approach has already been used with great success for the solution of quadratic eigenproblems associated with acoustic problems.",

This work proposes a data-driven framework to address both the above components for two-phase materials (composites with two materials mixed together, each having distinct material properties) and presents the algorithmic backbone to such a framework. In line with the two components above, a set of numerical algorithms is presented for characterization and reconstruction of two-phase materials from microscopic images: these include grayscale image binarization, point-correlation and cluster-correlation characterization, and simulated annealing algorithm for microstructure reconstruction. Another set of algorithms is proposed to connect the material processing parameters with the resulting microstructure by mapping nonlinear, nonphysical regression parameters in microstructure correlation functions to a physically based, simple regression model of key material characteristic parameters. This methodology that relates material design variables to material structure is crucial for stochastic multiscale material design. "

abstract={An evidence-based approach is developed for optimization of structural components under material parameter uncertainty. The approach is applied to evidence-based design optimization (EBDO) of externally stiffened circular tubes under axial impact load using an isotropic–elastic–plastic plasticity model to simulate dynamic material behaviour. Uncertainty modelling considers the changes in material parameters that are caused by variability in material properties as well as incertitude and errors in experimental data and procedure to determine the material parameters. Spatial variation of material parameters across the structural component is modelled using a field joint belief structure and propagated for the calculation of evidence-based objective function and design constraints. Surrogate models are used in both uncertainty propagation and solution of the optimization problem. The methodology and the solution to the EBDO example problem are presented and discussed.}}

abstract={A multiscale design methodology is proposed for hierarchical material and product systems with random field uncertainty that propagates across multiple length scales. Using the generalized hierarchical multiscale decomposition pattern in multiscale modeling, a set of computational techniques is developed to manage the system complexity. Design of experiments and metamodeling strategies are proposed to manage the complexity of propagating random field uncertainty through three generalized levels of transformation: the material microstructure random field, the material property random field, and the probabilistic product performance. Multilevel optimization techniques are employed to find optimal design solutions at individual scales. A hierarchical multiscale design problem that involves a two-scale (submicro- and microscales) material design and a macroscale product (bracket) design is used to demonstrate the applicability and benefits of the proposed methodology.}}

abstract = { This article presents a review of key historical contributions, the current status, and future research avenues in support of the development of supersonic aircraft that are sufficiently quiet so that they can be allowed to fly supersonically over land. For this goal to be achievable, in addition to overcoming many other challenges in aerodynamics, structures, propulsion, acoustics, and aeroservoelasticity, the pressure signature created by the aircraft must be such that, when it reaches the ground, (a) it can barely be perceived by the human ear, and (b) it results in disturbances to man-made structures that do not exceed the threshold of annoyance for a significant percentage of the population. In other words, the ground-boom signature must meet a number of key constraints that can be appropriately quantified. In designing aircraft with low sonic booms, it is important to understand (a) how pressure disturbances are generated and how they propagate through the atmosphere, (b) under which conditions will the pressure signature created by an aircraft evolve to generate an acceptable low-boom signature at the ground, and (c) what multidisciplinary trade-offs need to be made to realize low-boom aircraft that are also economically and environmentally compliant. This article discusses each of these areas separately, assesses the accomplishments in each topic, identifies significant shortcomings, and suggests future research efforts (some already ongoing) that have the potential to yield solutions to all these issues. }}

number="1",
pages="183--215",
abstract="Quadratic models of objective functions are highly useful in many optimization algorithms. They are updated regularly to include new information about the objective function, such as the difference between two gradient vectors. We consider the case, however, when each model interpolates some function values, so an update is required when a new function value replaces an old one. We let the number of interpolation conditions, m say, be such that there is freedom in each new quadratic model that is taken up by minimizing the Frobenius norm of the second derivative matrix of the change to the model. This variational problem is expressed as the solution of an (m+n+1){\texttimes}(m+n+1) system of linear equations, where n is the number of variables of the objective function. Further, the inverse of the matrix of the system provides the coefficients of quadratic Lagrange functions of the current interpolation problem. A method is presented for updating all these coefficients in                                    ({\{}m+n{\}}2) operations, which allows the model to be updated too. An extension to the method is also described that suppresses the constant terms of the Lagrange functions. These techniques have a useful stability property that is investigated in some numerical experiments.",

Several formulations are presented: Reliability-based optimal design of structural systems with component or systems reliability constraints, reliability-based optimal inspection planning and reliability-based experiment planning. It is explained how these optimization problems can be solved by application of similar techniques. The reliability estimation is limited to first order reliability methods (FORM) for both component and systems reliability evaluation. The solution strategies applying first order non-linear optimization algorithms are described in detail with special attention to sensitivity analysis and stability of the optimization process. Furthermore, several practical aspects are treated as: Development of the reliability-based optimization model, inclusion of the finite element method as the response evaluation tool and how the size of the problem can be made practicable. Finally, the important task of model evaluation and sensitivity analysis of the optimal solution is treated including a strategy for model-making with both pre and post-analysis."

Different perspectives of the general approach are consistent in prescribing the probabilistic constraint, where the conventional reliability index approach (RIA) and the proposed performance measure approach (PMA) are identified as two special cases. PMA is shown to be inherently robust and more efficient in evaluating inactive probabilistic constraints, while RIA is more efficient for violated probabilistic constraints. Moreover, RBDO often yields a higher rate of convergence by using PMA, while RIA yields singularity in some cases.}}

abstract={An integrated design framework that employs multiscale analysis to facilitate concurrent product, material, and manufacturing process design is presented in this work. To account for uncertainties associated with material structures and their impact on product performance across multiple scales, efficient computational techniques are developed for propagating material uncertainty with random field representation. Random field is employed to realistically model the uncertainty existing in material microstructure, which spatially varies in a product inherited from the manufacturing process. To reduce the dimensionality of random field representation, a reduced order Karhunen–Loeve expansion is used with a discretization scheme applied to finite-element meshes. The univariate dimension reduction method and the Gaussian quadrature formula are used to efficiently quantify the uncertainties in product performance in terms of its statistical moments, which are critical information for design under uncertainty. A control arm example is used to demonstrate the proposed approach. The impact of the initial microscale porosity random field produced during a casting process on the product damage is studied and a reliability-based design of the control arm is performed.}}

abstract = "An error estimation and grid adaptive strategy is presented for estimating and reducing simulation errors in functional outputs of partial differential equations. The procedure is based on an adjoint formulation in which the estimated error in the functional can be directly related to the local residual errors of both the primal and adjoint solutions. This relationship allows local error contributions to be used as indicators in a grid-adaptive strategy designed to produce specially tuned grids for accurately estimating the chosen functional. In this paper, attention is limited to one-dimensional problems, although the procedure is readily extendable to multiple dimensions. The error estimation procedure is applied to a standard, second-order, finite volume discretization of the quasi-one-dimensional Euler equations. Both isentropic and shocked flows are considered. The chosen functional of interest is the integrated pressure along a variable-area duct. The error estimation procedure, applied on uniform grids, provides superconvergent values of the corrected functional. Results demonstrate that additional improvements in the accuracy of the functional can be achieved by applying the proposed adaptive strategy to an initially uniform grid. The proposed adaptive strategy is also compared with a standard adaptive scheme based on the interpolation error in the computed pressure. The proposed scheme consistently yields more accurate functional predictions than does the standard scheme. "

We conclude that the actually practical error estimation techniques do not provide mathematically proven bounds on the error and need to be used with care. The more accurate estimation procedures also do not provide proven bounds that, in general, can be computed efficiently. We also briefly comment upon the state of error estimations in nonlinear and transient analyses and when mixed methods are used. "

Thus adaptive mesh-refinement techniques based on these estimators are capable to detect local singularities of the solution and to appropriately refine the grid near these singularities. Some numerical examples prove the efficiency of the error estimators and the mesh-refinement techniques."

abstract="In this study, a posteriori error estimation and goal-oriented mesh adaptivity are developed for phase-field fracture propagation. Goal functionals are computed with the dual-weighted residual (DWR) method, which is realized by a recently introduced novel localization technique based on a partition-of-unity (PU). This technique is straightforward to apply since the weak residual is used. The influence of neighboring cells is gathered by the PU. Consequently, neither strong residuals nor jumps over element edges are required. Therefore, this approach facilitates the application of the DWR method to coupled (nonlinear) multiphysics problems such as fracture propagation. These developments then allow for a systematic investigation of the discretization error for certain quantities of interest. Specifically, our focus on the relationship between the phase-field regularization and the spatial discretization parameter in terms of goal functional evaluations is novel.",

The procedure merges output error control with Hessian-based anisotropic grid adaptation. An adjoint formulation is used to relate the estimated functional error to the local residual errors of both the primal and adjoint solutions. This relationship allows local error contributions to be used as indicators in a grid adaptive method designed to produce specially tuned grids for accurately estimating the chosen functional. Element stretching and orientation information is obtained from interpolation error estimates for linear triangular finite elements. The proposed adaptive method is implemented using a standard second-order upwind finite volume discretization, although the procedure is applicable to other types of discretizations such as the finite element method. A series of airfoil test cases, including separated, high-lift flows, are presented to demonstrate the approach; the functionals considered are the lift and drag coefficients. The proposed adaptive method is shown to be superior in terms of reliability and output accuracy relative to pure Hessian-based adaptation. "

abstract="Solving large-scale PDE-constrained optimization problems presents computational challenges due to the large dimensional set of underlying equations that have to be handled by the optimizer. Recently, projection-based nonlinear reduced-order models have been proposed to be used in place of high-dimensional models in a design optimization procedure. The dimensionality of the solution space is reduced using a reduced-order basis constructed by Proper Orthogonal Decomposition. In the case of nonlinear equations, however, this is not sufficient to ensure that the cost associated with the optimization procedure does not scale with the high dimension. To achieve that goal, an additional reduction step, hyper-reduction is applied. Then, solving the resulting reduced set of equations only requires a reduced dimensional domain and large speedups can be achieved. In the case of design optimization, it is shown in this paper that an additional approximation of the objective function is required. This is achieved by the construction of a surrogate objective using radial basis functions. The proposed method is illustrated with two applications: the shape optimization of a simplified nozzle inlet model and the design optimization of a chemical reaction.",

Deployed systems require real-time and certified output prediction in support of immediate and safe (feasible) action. The two essential components of our approach are (i) rapidly, uniformly convergent reduced-basis approximations, and (ii) associated rigorous and sharp a posteriori error bounds; in both components we exploit affine parametric structure and offline–online computational decompositions to provide real-time deployed response. In this paper we extend our methodology to the parametrized steady incompressible Navier–Stokes equations.We invoke the Brezzi–Rappaz–Raviart theory for analysis of variational approximations of non-linear partial differential equations to construct rigorous, quantitative, sharp, inexpensive a posteriori error estimators. The crucial new contribution is offline–online computational procedures for calculation of (a) the dual norm of the requisite residuals, (b) an upper bound for the ‘L4(Ω)-H1(Ω)’ Sobolev embedding continuity constant, (c) a lower bound for the Babuška inf–sup stability ‘constant,’ and (d) the adjoint contributions associated with the output. Numerical results for natural convection in a cavity confirm the rapid convergence of the reduced-basis approximation, the good effectivity of the associated a posteriori error bounds in the energy and output norms, and the rapid deployed response.

In this paper, we first present the application of the interpolation technique on Grassmann manifolds to this problem. We then improve the method for the models whose system matrices depend affinely on parameters by considerably reducing the computational complexity on the basis of analyzing the structure of sums of singular value decompositions and decomposing the whole procedure into offline and online stages.

abstract = {An adaptive and efficient approach for constructing reduced-order models (ROMs) that are robust to changes in parameters is developed. The approach is based on a greedy sampling of the underlying high-dimensional model (HDM) together with an efficient procedure for exploring the configuration space and identifying parameters for which the error is likely to be high. Because this exploration is based on a surrogate model for an error indicator, it is amenable to a fast training phase. Furthermore, a model for the exact error based on the error indicator is constructed and used to determine when the greedy procedure reaches a desired error tolerance. An efficient procedure for updating the reduced-order basis constructed by proper orthogonal decomposition is also introduced in this paper, avoiding the cost associated with computing large-scale singular value decompositions. The proposed procedure is then shown to require less evaluations of a posteriori error estimators than the classical procedure in order to identify locations of the parameter space to be sampled. It is illustrated on the training of parametric ROMs for three linear and nonlinear mechanical systems, including the realistic prediction of the response of a V-hull vehicle to underbody blasts.}}

abstract={We present a technique for the rapid and reliable prediction of linear-functional outputs of elliptic (and parabolic) partial differential equations with affine parameter dependence. The essential components are (i) (provably) rapidly convergent global reduced-basis approximations—Galerkin projection onto a space WN spanned by solutions of the governing partial differential equation at N selected points in parameter space; (ii) a posteriori error estimation—relaxations of the error-residual equation that provide inexpensive yet sharp and rigorous bounds for the error in the outputs of interest; and (iii) off-line/on-line computational procedures methods which decouple the generation and projection stages of the approximation process. The operation count for the on-line stage in which, given a new parameter value, we calculate the output of interest and associated error bound, depends only on N (typically very small) and the parametric complexity of the problem; the method is thus ideally suited for the repeated and rapid evaluations required in the context of parameter estimation, design, optimization, and real-time control.}}

abstract = {Topology optimization of large scale structures is computationally expensive, notably because of the cost of solving the equilibrium equations at each iteration. Reduced order models by projection, also known as reduced basis models, have been proposed in the past for alleviating this cost. We propose here a new method for coupling reduced basis models with topology optimization to improve the efficiency of topology optimization of large scale structures. The novel approach is based on constructing the reduced basis on the fly, using previously calculated solutions of the equilibrium equations. The reduced basis is thus adaptively constructed and enriched, based on the convergence behavior of the topology optimization. A direct approach and an approach with adjusted sensitivities are described, and their algorithms provided. The approaches are tested and compared on various 2D and 3D minimum compliance topology optimization benchmark problems. Computational cost savings by up to a factor of 12 are demonstrated using the proposed methods. Copyright © 2014 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}

abstract = {We present a model reduction approach to the solution of large-scale statistical inverse problems in a Bayesian inference setting. A key to the model reduction is an efficient representation of the non-linear terms in the reduced model. To achieve this, we present a formulation that employs masked projection of the discrete equations; that is, we compute an approximation of the non-linear term using a select subset of interpolation points. Further, through this formulation we show similarities among the existing techniques of gappy proper orthogonal decomposition, missing point estimation, and empirical interpolation via coefficient-function approximation. The resulting model reduction methodology is applied to a highly non-linear combustion problem governed by an advection–diffusion-reaction partial differential equation (PDE). Our reduced model is used as a surrogate for a finite element discretization of the non-linear PDE within the Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling employed by the Bayesian inference approach. In two spatial dimensions, we show that this approach yields accurate results while reducing the computational cost by several orders of magnitude. For the full three-dimensional problem, a forward solve using a reduced model that has high fidelity over the input parameter space is more than two million times faster than the full-order finite element model, making tractable the solution of the statistical inverse problem that would otherwise require many years of CPU time.

In this work, interpolation among reduced-order matrices is proposed as a means to obtain parameterized ROMs. These ROMs are fast to evaluate and solve, and can be constructed without reference to the original full-order model. Spline interpolation of the reduced-order system matrices in the original space and in the space tangent to the Riemannian manifold is compared with Kriging interpolation of the predicted outputs. A heuristic criterion to select the most appropriate interpolation space is proposed. The interpolation approach is applied to a steady-state thermal design problem and probabilistic analysis via Monte Carlo simulation of an unsteady contaminant transport problem.

abstract="The purpose of the last three sections is to demonstrate by representative examples that control theory can be used to formulate computationally feasible procedures for aerodynamic design. The cost of each iteration is of the same order as two flow solutions, since the adjoint equation is of comparable complexity to the flow equation, and the remaining auxiliary equations could be solved quite inexpensively. Provided, therefore, that one can afford the cost of a moderate number of flow solutions, procedures of this type can be used to derive improved designs. The approach is quite general, not limited to particular choices of the coordinate transformation or cost function, which might in fact contain measures of other criteria of performance such as lift and drag. For the sake of simplicity certain complicating factors, such as the need to include a special term in the mapping function to generate a corner at the trailing edge, have been suppressed from the present analysis. Also it remains to explore the numerical implementation of the design procedures proposed in this paper.",

Polynomial chaos (PC) methods have found increased use in probabilistic UQ over the past decade. This review describes the use of PC expansions for the representation of random variables/fields and discusses their utility for the propagation of uncertainty in computational models, focusing on CFD models. Many CFD applications are considered, including flow in porous media, incompressible and compressible flows, and thermofluid and reacting flows. The review examines each application area, focusing on the demonstrated use of PC UQ and the associated challenges. Cross-cutting challenges with time unsteadiness and long time horizons are also discussed. }}

A design space is parametrized by design patches, which are fixed during the optimization process and are identical to the finite element discretization. The structural layout is determined, whether or not there is material in the design patches. Since many design patches are necessary to describe approximately the structural layout, this procedure leads to a large number of optimization variables. Furthermore, due to a lack of clearness and smoothness, the results obtained can often only be used as a conceptual design idea.",

abstract = {Abstract A new methodology is proposed for the topology optimization of fluid in Stokes flow. The binary design variable and no-slip condition along the solid–fluid interface are regularized to allow for the use of continuous mathematical programming techniques. The regularization is achieved by treating the solid phase of the topology as a porous medium with flow governed by Darcy's law. Fluid flow throughout the design domain is then expressed as a single system of equations created by combining and scaling the Stokes and Darcy equations. The mixed formulation of the new Darcy–Stokes system is solved numerically using existing stabilized finite element methods for the individual flow problems. Convergence to the no-slip condition is demonstrated by assigning a low permeability to solid phase and results suggest that auxiliary boundary conditions along the solid–fluid interface are not needed. The optimization objective considered is to minimize dissipated power and the technique is used to solve examples previously examined in literature. The advantages of the Darcy–Stokes approach include that it uses existing stabilization techniques to solve the finite element problem, it produces 0–1 (void–solid) topologies (i.e. there are no regions of artificial material), and that it can potentially be used to optimize the layout of a microscopically porous material.

abstract="This study focuses on finding the optimal layout of fluidic devices subjected to incompressible flow at low Reynolds numbers. The proposed approach uses a levelset method to describe the fluid-solid interface geometry. The flow field is modeled by the incompressible Navier--Stokes equations and discretized by the extended finite element method (XFEM). The no-slip condition along the fluid-solid interface is enforced via a stabilized Lagrange multiplier method. Unlike the commonly used porosity approach, the XFEM approach does not rely on a material interpolation scheme, which allows for more flexibility in formulating the design problems. Further, it mitigates shortcomings of the porosity approach, including spurious pressure diffusion through solid material, strong dependency of the accuracy of the boundary enforcement with respect to the model parameters which may affect the optimization results, and poor boundary resolution. Numerical studies verify that the proposed method is able to recover optimization results obtained with the porosity approach. Further, it is demonstrated that the XFEM approach yields physical results for problems that cannot be solved with the porosity approach.",

abstract = "In this work a fully partitioned Lagrangian framework for the solution of fluid–structure interaction (FSI) problems involving free surfaces, large solid displacements and deformations, and strong added mass effects is presented. The fluid is simulated using the Particle Finite Element Method (PFEM), while Metafor, a large deformations nonlinear Finite Element code, is employed to simulate the solid part. The fully partitioned coupling is ensured through an Interface Quasi-Newton Inverse Least Squares (IQN-ILS) (Degroote et al., 2009) strategy to avoid added mass effects. The Lagrangian particle nature of the PFEM allows the simulation of problems involving free surfaces and very large solid displacements, usually difficult to achieve with traditional body-fitted CFD techniques. We show that owing to the generality of its formulation the PFEM can be used as is in the framework of fully partitioned FSI coupling schemes, where minimal information (i.e. loads and displacements at the FSI interface) is exchanged between the fluid and the solid solvers. More importantly, we demonstrate that a fully partitioned PFEM–FEM coupling based on the IQN-ILS strategy allows the simulation of a very large spectrum of FSI problems without incurring added-mass instabilities. The performance of the IQN-ILS coupling strategy in a fully Lagrangian framework is also assessed and compared to more traditional approaches such as Block-Gauss–Seidel (BGS) iterations with Aitken relaxation. An extensive work of verification and benchmarking is proposed, aiming to encompass all the combinations of physical and numerical parameters possibly leading to added-mass instabilities, and testing the IQN-ILS strategy on different benchmarks beyond those already proposed in the literature. The coupling is performed through CUPyDO (Thomas et al., 2019), a general Python framework for partitioned FSI coupling."

@article{CuPyDO2019,
abstract = {CUPyDO, a fluid-structure interaction (FSI) tool that couples existing independent fluid and solid solvers into a single synchronization and communication framework based on the Python language is presented. Each coupled solver has to be wrapped in a Python layer in order to embed their functionalities (usually written in a compiled language) into a Python object, that is called and used by the coupler. Thus a staggered strong coupling can be achieved for time-dependent FSI problems such as aeroelastic flutter, vortex-induced vibrations (VIV) or conjugate heat transfer (CHT). The synchronization between the solvers is performed with the predictive block-Gauss-Seidel algorithm with dynamic under-relaxation. The tool is capable of treating non-matching meshes between the fluid and structure domains and is optimized to work in parallel using Message Passing Interface (MPI). The implementation of CUPyDO is described and its capabilities are demonstrated on typical validation cases. The open-source code SU2 is used to solve the fluid equations while the solid equations are solved either by a simple rigid body integrator or by in-house linear/nonlinear Finite Element codes (GetDP/Metafor). First, the modularity of the coupling as well as its ease of use is highlighted and then the accuracy of the results is demonstrated.},

Dynamic interactions between fluids and structures may change dynamic characteristics of the structure and its response to external excitation parameters such as seismic loading. This paper describes a parallel coupling analysis system for large-scale AFSI problems using iterative partitioned coupling techniques. We employ an open source parallel finite element analysis system called ADVENTURE, which adopts an efficient preconditioned iterative linear algebraic solver. In addition, we have recently developed a parallel coupling tool called ADVENTURE{\_}Coupler to efficiently handle interface variables in various parallel computing environments. We also employ the Broyden method for updating interface variables to attain robust and fast convergence of fixed-point iterations. This paper describes key features of the coupling analysis system developed, and we perform tests to validate its performance for several AFSI problems. The system runs efficiently in a parallel environment, and it is capable of analyzing three-dimensional-complex-shaped structures with more than 20 million degrees-of-freedom (DOFs). Its numerical results also show good agreement with experimental results.",

abstract = "In the emerging field of multi-physics simulations, we often face the challenge to establish new connections between physical fields, to add additional aspects to existing models, or to exchange a solver for one of the involved physical fields. If in such cases a fast prototyping of a coupled simulation environment is required, a partitioned setup using existing codes for each physical field is the optimal choice. As accurate models require also accurate numerics, multi-physics simulations typically use very high grid resolutions and, accordingly, are run on massively parallel computers. Here, we face the challenge to combine flexibility with parallel scalability and hardware efficiency. In this paper, we present the coupling tool preCICE which offers the complete coupling functionality required for a fast development of a multi-physics environment using existing, possibly black-box solvers. We hereby restrict ourselves to bidirectional surface coupling which is too expensive to be done via file communication, but in contrast to volume coupling still a candidate for distributed memory parallelism between the involved solvers. The paper gives an overview of the numerical functionalities implemented in preCICE as well as the user interfaces, i.e., the application programming interface and configuration options. Our numerical examples and the list of different open-source and commercial codes that have already been used with preCICE in coupled simulations show the high flexibility, the correctness, and the high performance and parallel scalability of coupled simulations with preCICE as the coupling unit."

In this context, the current work aims at studying the scalability of code coupling on high performance computing architectures for a conjugate heat transfer problem. The flow solver is a Large Eddy Simulation code that has been already ported on massively parallel architectures. The conduction solver is based on the same data structure and thus shares the flow solver scalability properties. Accurately coupling solvers on massively parallel architectures while maintaining their scalability is challenging. It requires exchanging and treating information based on two different computational grids that are partitioned differently on a different number of cores. Such transfers have to be thought to maintain code scalabilities while maintaining numerical accuracy. This raises communication and high performance computing issues: transferring data from a distributed interface to another distributed interface in a parallel way and on a very large number of processors is not straightforward and solutions are not clear. Performance tests have been carried out up to 12 288 cores on the CURIE supercomputer (TGCC/CEA). Results show a good behavior of the coupled model when increasing the number of cores thanks to the fully distributed exchange process implemented in the coupler. Advanced analyses are carried out to draw new paths for future developments for coupled simulations: i.e. optimization of the data transfer protocols through asynchronous communications or coupling-aware preprocessing of the coupled models (mesh partitioning phase).}

abstract="Robust design optimization (RDO) has been eminent in determining the optimal design of real-time complex systems under stochastic environment. Unlike conventional optimization, RDO involves uncertainty quantification which may render the procedure to be computationally intensive, if not prohibitive. In order to deal with such issues, an efficient approximation-based generalized RDO framework has been proposed. Since RDO formulation comprises of statistical terms of the performance functions, the proposed framework deals with approximation of those statistical quantities, rather than the performance functions. Consequently, the proposed framework allows transformation of the RDO problem to an equivalent deterministic one. As a result, unlike traditional surrogate-assisted RDO, the proposed framework yields desirable results in significantly less number of functional evaluations. For performing such response statistical approximation, two adaptive sparse refined Kriging-based computational models have been proposed. However, the generality of the proposed methodology allows any surrogate models to be employed within this framework, provided it is capable of capturing the functional non-linearity. Implementation of the proposed framework in three test examples and two finite element-based practical problems clearly illustrates its potential for further complicated applications.",

We then discuss the types of stochastic noises that are used as inputs to the PDEs and, for the case of infinite stochastic processes, how those inputs are approximated so that they are amenable to computations. We then review methods that are used to obtain approximations of solutions of PDEs with random inputs, with special emphases given to stochastic Galerkin and stochastic sampling methods, including sparse-grid methods in the latter case.

Because of the lack of sparsity of discretized nonlocal models relative to analogous local partial differential equation models, the need for reduced-order modeling is much more acute in the nonlocal setting. In this effort, we develop reduced-basis approximations for nonlocal diffusion equations with affine random coefficients. Efficiency estimates of the proposed greedy reduced-basis methods are provided. Numerical examples are used to illustrate the effect varying various model parameters have on the efficiency and accuracy of the reduced-basis method relative to sparse-grid interpolation using the full finite element method. It is shown that the proposed reduced-basis approach can indeed provide substantial savings over standard sparse-grid methods."

The two dominating approximate methods for obtaining the statistical properties of the response from those of the stochastic properties of the system – the perturbation and the spectral method – are described in detail, and it is explained how statically determinate systems constitute a special case, permitting more general results. The final section deals with reliability methods, the purpose of which is to obtain the probability or a probability estimate, of a rare event, for example, failure.

abstract="In this paper, mixed aleatory/epistemic uncertainties in a robust design problem are propagated via the use of box-constrained optimizations and surrogate models. The assumption is that the uncertain input parameters can be divided into a set only containing aleatory uncertainties and a set with only epistemic uncertainties. Uncertainties due to the epistemic inputs can then be propagated via a box-constrained optimization approach, while the uncertainties due to aleatory inputs can be propagated via sampling. A statistics-of-intervals approach is used in which the box-constrained optimization results are treated as a random variable and multiple optimizations need to be performed to quantify the aleatory uncertainties via sampling. A Kriging surrogate is employed to model the variation of the optimization results with respect to the aleatory variables enabling exhaustive Monte-Carlo sampling to determine the desired statistics for each robust design iteration. This approach is applied to the robust design of a transonic NACA 0012 airfoil where shape design variables are assumed to have epistemic uncertainties and the angle of attack and Mach number are considered to have aleatory uncertainties. The very good scalability of the framework in the number of epistemic variables is demonstrated as well.",

abstract = "Rotorcraft are commonly required to fly at low altitudes and this places them at a high risk of striking various types of obstacles. Wires, in particular, are very difficult to discern and easily blend in the background which explains why wire strikes are a major cause of helicopter accidents. In the context of helicopter operations, a wire hazard is any wire or structure supporting those wires that presents a danger to the aircraft. Data from the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) shows that wire strikes were responsible for 124 fatalities between 1994 and 2018. Data on civil helicopter wire strikes further show that the majority of helicopter models involved fall in the lightweight category. In this study, existing aircraft-mounted and ground-based wire strike prevention and protection technologies are reviewed, along with some other potential technologies that have not been specifically developed for use on helicopters but that might be able to prevent wire strikes. In particular, commercially available wire detection systems such as laser scanning systems, database-dependent warning systems, wire cutters, radar scanners and aerial markers are surveyed and evaluated against each other. Publicly available databases of transmission lines in the U.S. are identified and documented for the development of wire strike prevention technologies for lightweight helicopters. The feasibility of creating useful maps of wires from tabulated data or image data is discussed and various Electronic Flight Bag manufacturers are surveyed and compared to determine the feasibility of integrating and displaying such information in the cockpit. Challenges of implementing safety devices, in particular wire cutters, on lightweight helicopters are also discussed and recommendations are provided to improve helicopter wire strike safety. Finally, a multi-criteria decision-making analysis is carried out to rank wire strike safety devices and compare the robustness of their rankings with respect to various operator's preference scenarios. It is shown that the Electronic Flight Bag (EFB), the Wire Strike Protection System (WSPS), the Obstacle Collision Avoidance System (OCAS), and the wire markers perform best regardless of the scenario."
